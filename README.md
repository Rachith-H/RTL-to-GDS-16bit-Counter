# RTL-to-GDS-16bit-Counter
Complete RTL-to-GDSII implementation of a synchronous counter using OpenLane and Sky130 PDK. This project demonstrates the full ASIC digital flow from Verilog RTL through synthesis, floorplanning, placement, CTS, routing, and final GDS generation using open-source EDA tools.
